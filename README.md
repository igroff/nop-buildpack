#### nop Buildpack

This build pack does nothing at all. The purpose is to allow starphleet to
build a container for you so that other scripts (`*_containerize`) can be run
allowing you to piggyback on the repository change detection built into
starphleet to trigger execution of those other scripts.

#### What else does it do?

Nothing.
